-- Relative Difficulty: 5

-- Remove all elements in a `List` that fail a given predicate.

-- Exercise 12
-- Relative Difficulty: 10
-- A happy number is a positive integer, where the sum of the square of its digits eventually reaches 1 after repetition.
-- In contrast, a sad number (not a happy number) is where the sum of the square of its digits never reaches 1
-- because it results in a recurring sequence.
-- ~~~ Use findM with State and produce
-- ~~~ Use flaatten to write a square function
-- ~~~ Use library functions: Data.Foldable#elem, Data.Char#digitToInt
