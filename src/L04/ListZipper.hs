-- A `ListZipper` is a focussed position, with a list of values to the left and to the right.

-- For example, taking the list [0,1,2,3,4,5,6], the moving focus to the third position, the zipper looks like:
-- ListZipper [2,1,0] 3 [4,5,6]
--
-- Supposing then we move left on this zipper:
-- ListZipper [1,0] 2 [3,4,5,6]
--
-- then suppose we add 17 to the focus of this zipper:
-- ListZipper [1,0] 19 [3,4,5,6]
