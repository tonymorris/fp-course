Installation
============

Getting up and running
----------------------

Install the Haskell interpreter GHCI:

    http://www.haskell.org/platform/

Install the Haskell dependency management system cabal:

    http://www.haskell.org/cabal/

    (you will need to follow the additional instructions)

Install tutorial dependencies:

    $ cabal update
    $ cabal install QuickCheck
    $ cabal install test-framework-quickcheck2
    $ cabal install test-framework-hunit

Type 'ghci' from the top level of this project.  This loads
the .ghci file which in turn references src/Course.hs -
the source of goodness.

With a bit of luck you're off and running :-)
